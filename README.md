# 3D-Reconstruction
## Datasets
I worked on pix3d dataset that you can Download from Kaggle and you can reach to it with this link:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bob607/pix3d-full-dataset)
the dataset contains three folders each folder contains multiple objects
folders consist of

    img which contains images.
    mask contain a mask for each object in images like chairs or beds etc.
    model which contains 3D objects for each object in the images.

and finally, you can find pix3d.json file which contain all information about dataset like paths etc.

## Process
You can reach to my Jupyter Code and see the output and for the input you just need the JSON file cause i used JSON to process data
